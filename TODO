PokeHer TODO list:

* Pot odds

** Flop hand win %
** post-flop probability
*** flop: simulate?
*** turn: simulate?
*** river: exhaustive search
* Probabilistic framework for call/raise/check/fold based on pot odds
* Set up actions
** background thread for picking actions

* Automated bot vs bot framework
** reporting

** jenkins?

* Opponent modelling
** record % hands to each street
** record raise sequence, use histogram for analysis?

* Notes

SB: The ideal raise from the small-blind is to 2-3 big-blinds, but
with the changes (and loose play) that online poker has brought, I
suggest raising it to 2.5-4 big-blinds.

BB: . You want to either end the hand pre-flop, or end it with a solid
continuation-bet on the flop should your opponent call your pre-flop
bet. I'd suggest a range of 3-5 big-blinds on top of your
already-posted blind. A raise of that size gives your opponent at best
1.67:1 odds
