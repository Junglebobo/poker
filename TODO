SB: The ideal raise from the small-blind is to 2-3 big-blinds, but
with the changes (and loose play) that online poker has brought, I
suggest raising it to 2.5-4 big-blinds.

BB: . You want to either end the hand pre-flop, or end it with a solid
continuation-bet on the flop should your opponent call your pre-flop
bet. I'd suggest a range of 3-5 big-blinds on top of your
already-posted blind. A raise of that size gives your opponent at best
1.67:1 odds
